    <string name="tell_more_astronomical_units_title">What does astronomical really units means?</string>
    <string name="tell_more_astronomical_units">The astronomical unit (symbol: au, or AU) is a unit of length, roughly the distance from Earth to the Sun and equal to about 150 million kilometres (93 million miles) or ~8 light minutes. The actual distance varies by about 3% as Earth orbits the Sun, from a maximum (aphelion) to a minimum (perihelion) and back again once each year. The au was originally conceived as the average of Earth\'s aphelion and perihelion; however, since 2012 it has been defined as exactly 149,597,870,700 m. \n\nSource: \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit</string>

    <string name="tell_more_lunar_units_title">What does lunar units really means?</string>
    <string name="tell_more_lunar_units">Lunar distance (LD), also called Earth–Moon distance, Earth–Moon characteristic distance, or distance to the Moon, is a unit of measure in astronomy. It is the average distance from the center of Earth to the center of the Moon. More technically, it is the mean semi-major axis of the geocentric lunar orbit. It may also refer to the time-averaged distance between the centers of the Earth and the Moon, or less commonly, the instantaneous Earth–Moon distance. The lunar distance is approximately 400,000 km, which is a quarter of a million miles or 1.28 light-seconds. This is roughly Earth\'s circumference times ten, its diameter times thirty or 1/389 of Earth\'s distance to the Sun (the astronomical unit).\n\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_distance_(astronomy)</string>

    <string name="sample_text_picture_of_the_day_explanation">This shadowy landscape of majestic mountains and icy plains stretches toward the horizon on a small, distant world. It was captured from a range of about 18,000 kilometers when New Horizons looked back toward Pluto, 15 minutes after the spacecraft\'s closest approach on July 14, 2015. The dramatic, low-angle, near-twilight scene follows rugged mountains formally known as Norgay Montes from foreground left, and Hillary Montes along the horizon, giving way to smooth Sputnik Planum at right. Layers of Pluto\'s tenuous atmosphere are also revealed in the backlit view. With a strangely familiar appearance, the frigid terrain likely includes ices of nitrogen and carbon monoxide with water-ice mountains rising up to 3,500 meters (11,000 feet). That\'s comparable in height to the majestic mountains of planet Earth. The Plutonian landscape is 380 kilometers (230 miles) across.</string>
